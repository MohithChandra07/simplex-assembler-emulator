## What is this project?

The **SIMPLEX ISA** is a minimal 32-bit instruction set architecture. This project builds the entire software toolchain for it from scratch:

- You write assembly code in SIMPLEX assembly language
- The **assembler** (`asm.cpp`) reads your `.asm` file and produces a binary object file (`.o`) along with a human-readable listing and error log
- The **emulator** (`emu.cpp`) loads that binary and actually executes it, showing you how registers and memory change at every step
- The **SIMPLEX Studio** web app lets you do all of the above directly in your browser, with a live symbol table, machine code table, step-by-step emulator, and an AI panel that explains any instruction you click on

Everything is written from scratch in C++ (CLI tools) and vanilla HTML/JS (web app) — no external libraries or frameworks.

## 🌐 SIMPLEX Studio — Web App

A fully interactive browser-based IDE for SIMPLEX assembly — no installation, no server, just open the HTML file and go.

### Screenshots

**Assembler Panel** — type or paste any SIMPLEX assembly program. The machine code output table, symbol table, and error/warning panel update instantly after you hit Assemble.

![SIMPLEX Studio - Assembler View](assets/demo1.png)

**Emulator Panel** — after assembling, switch to the emulator. Step through instructions one at a time or run all at once. Every register (A, B, SP, PC) is shown live. Click any instruction row to get an **AI-powered explanation** of exactly what that instruction does, how it is encoded in binary, and what changes in the registers.

## 🔧 How the Assembler Works

The assembler is a classic **two-pass** design implemented entirely in `asm.cpp`.

### Pass 1 — Build the Symbol Table
The assembler reads every line of the `.asm` file without generating code. It tracks the program counter, records every label and the address it points to, and processes `SET` pseudo-instructions (which assign a value to a label without emitting any machine code). By the end of pass 1, every label in the entire program is known — including ones defined after they are first used (forward references).

### Pass 2 — Generate Machine Code
The assembler reads every line again. This time it encodes each instruction into a 32-bit machine word using the opcode table and the symbol table built in pass 1. Forward references are now fully resolved. Three output files are written:

| Output file | Contents |
|---|---|
| `<name>.lst` | Listing file — address, hex machine code word, original assembly line |
| `<name>.log` | Log file — same as listing, with all errors and warnings appended |
| `<name>.o` | Binary object file — raw 32-bit words ready for the emulator |

If there are any errors, the `.o` file is not produced. Lines with errors are skipped; all other lines are still assembled and appear in the listing.

### Error and Warning Detection

The assembler catches and reports every one of the following, with the exact line number:

| Category | Errors detected |
|---|---|
| Labels | Duplicate label definition, invalid label name (bad characters), undefined label at end of pass 2 |
| Operands | Missing operand where one is required, unexpected operand where none is allowed, extra text after a valid operand |
| Instructions | Invalid / unknown mnemonic |
| Numbers | Invalid numeric constant (not valid decimal / octal / hex) |
| SET | `SET` used without a label, `SET` used without a value |
| Warnings | Label declared but never referenced anywhere in the program |
| Warnings | Data directive (`data`) with no label (the word is unreachable) |

### Numeric constant formats supported

```
42        decimal
052       octal  (leading zero)
0x2A      hexadecimal
```

## ⚙️ How the Emulator Works

The emulator (`emu.cpp`) loads a `.o` binary into a 65,536-word memory array and executes it instruction by instruction, exactly following the SIMPLEX specification for all **19 opcodes (0–18)**.

### Registers

| Register | Role |
|---|---|
| A | Accumulator — primary arithmetic and logic register |
| B | Secondary / stack top register |
| SP | Stack pointer |
| PC | Program counter |

### Output files — selected with `-o` followed by any combination of digits

| Flag digit | File produced | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `1` | `.trace` | One line per instruction: PC, raw instruction word, mnemonic, operand, A, B, SP before execution |
| `2` | `.memdump` | Final memory contents printed 4 words per line (up to last non-zero word), plus final register values |
| `3` | `.before` | A, B, SP, PC before each instruction |
| `4` | `.after` | A, B, SP, PC after each instruction |

If you pass no `-o` flag, `.trace` is produced by default. You can combine digits freely — `-o 1234` produces all four files at once.

### Safety checks

The emulator detects and stops with an error message on:
- Program counter going out of bounds
- Unknown / unrecognised opcode
- Probable infinite loop (execution exceeds 11 million instructions)

## 🧪 All Test Programs

Eight assembly programs are included, covering everything from basic instructions to complex algorithms and deliberate error cases.

---

### Sum of the first N integers
**File:** `test5.asm`

Adds up all integers from 1 to N using a loop. For N = 10 the result is **55**.

```
Result after emulation:  0x00000037  (decimal 55)  ✓
Assembler:  0 errors · 0 warnings
```

---

### Multiplication by repeated addition
**File:** `test6.asm`

Computes A × B by adding A to itself B times. Demonstrates loops and counter decrement. For 6 × 7 the result is **42**.

```
Result after emulation:  0x0000002A  (decimal 42)  ✓
Assembler:  0 errors · 0 warnings
```

---

### Triangle numbers — recursive program
**File:** `test4.asm`

Computes the N-th triangle number (sum of 1 + 2 + … + N) using a recursive subroutine. For N = 10 the result is **55**. Exercises the call stack, `call`, `return`, and stack pointer manipulation.

```
Result after emulation:  0x00000037  (decimal 55)  ✓
Assembler:  0 errors · 0 warnings
```

---

### Bubble sort
**File:** `test9.asm`

Sorts an array of 10 integers using the bubble sort algorithm. After emulation the array in memory is fully sorted in ascending order. This is the most complex test — many labels, nested loops, and conditional branches.

```
Array after emulation:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]  ✓
Assembler:  0 errors · 0 warnings
```

---

### SET pseudo-instruction
**File:** `test3.asm`

Tests the `SET` directive, which assigns a constant value to a label without emitting any machine code. Verifies that the assembler correctly substitutes SET values into instructions that reference those labels.

```
val  SET 75   →   ldc val   loads 75 into A
val2 SET 66   →   adc val2  adds 66 → A = 141 (0x8D)
Result after emulation:  A = 0x0000008D  ✓
Assembler:  0 errors · 0 warnings
```

---

### Forward reference and loop
**File:** `test1.asm`

Tests that the two-pass assembler correctly resolves a label that is used before it is defined (forward reference). Also contains an infinite loop and a label that is defined but never used, which should produce exactly one warning.

```
Assembler:  0 errors · 1 warning (unused label)  ✓
Branch offset resolved correctly  ✓
```

---

### Error detection
**File:** `test2.asm`

A program deliberately full of mistakes — used to verify that the assembler catches every type of error correctly and reports them all with the right line numbers.

```
Assembler detects:  9 errors (duplicate label, undefined label, invalid number,
                    missing operand, unexpected operand, extra text,
                    invalid label name, two unknown mnemonics)
No object file produced  ✓
```

---

### Deliberate errors and warnings
**File:** `test8.asm`

A more comprehensive error test. Contains both error lines and valid lines mixed together — verifying that the assembler continues past errors and still assembles the valid parts into a listing.

```
Assembler detects:  8 errors · 2 warnings
Valid lines assembled and appear in listing  ✓
No object file produced  ✓
```

## 🛠 Build & Run

### Requirements
- `g++` (any version supporting C++11 or later)
- Any modern browser for the web app

### Assembler

```bash
# Compile
g++ asm.cpp -o asm

# Run on any .asm file
./asm test5.asm

# Output produced (if no errors):
#   test5.lst   — listing file
#   test5.log   — log with errors/warnings
#   test5.o     — binary object file
```

### Emulator

```bash
# Compile
g++ emu.cpp -o emu

# Run — produces trace file by default
./emu test5.o

# Run with specific outputs
./emu test5.o -o 1       # trace only
./emu test5.o -o 2       # memory dump only
./emu test5.o -o 14      # trace + after-state
./emu test5.o -o 1234    # all four output files

# Run multiple object files in one go
./emu test4.o test5.o test6.o -o 2
```

> **Note:** The `.asm` / `.o` file must be in the same directory as the binary when you run it.
